## Contributing

The content of this site is stored in markdown files in the [src/chapters folder](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-style-guide/tree/gh-pages/src/chapters). Change those files with your markdown editor of choice and send a pull request.

If you'd like to see the content rendered in the site itself, start by installing the site's npm dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

And then run `gulp`:

```
$ gulp
```

Gulp starts up a development server and launches the style guide in it. Gulp also watches for changes to files in the src folder (including the chapter Markdown files), and refreshes the site in your browser automatically.
