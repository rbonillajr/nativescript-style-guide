## Introduction

### What is this?

This is an opinionated guide to building native mobile apps with [NativeScript](http://nativescript.org). The advice this guide prescribes is by no means mandatory, however, the very opinionated authors of this guide believe that following these guidelines will help you produce high-quality, maintenance friendly, and performant apps with NativeScript.

Feel free to ignore tips that don't apply to your projects, or to build upon this advice based on your app's requirements. If you find an error in this guide, or would like to suggest new guidelines, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-style-guide/issues/new) in [this guide's GitHub repo](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-style-guide).
